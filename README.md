## What is this all about:
* The primary project's idea is about testing a hypothesis whether Elon Musk's tweets **significantly** affect crypto currencies (**BTC, ETH, DOGE**) or not.
* The secondaries are predicting crypto prices based on an input tweet. 

## Data prepequisites:
* I'm using all Elon Musk's tweets and only from **2010-06-0**4 to **2023-04-10** because snscrape stopped working due to some changes in Twitter policies and accessibility. May be fixed with time but for now that's it. (FIXED)
* **Text** and **English** only (other data decisions will be mentioned inside a notebook).

## Accessibility:
The project's findings i'll put inside main.ipynb with presentations so the main question's answer would be easy to follow.
Prediction part will be in a web-interface as a convenient way of interacting with a model
